# Prog-X Asset Tracker Southbound REST API #

Configuring a tracker from a cloud.

**Version of the configuration format/scheme: 1.0**

## Introduction ##

The configuration includes three blocks:
- "description" - read-only information returned by the tracker. Does not exist in the configuration update from a cloud.
- "configuration" - the main (Imp-Device) block of the tracker configuration.
- "agentConfiguration" - Imp-Agent block of the tracker configuration.

The tracker always has a full configuration (all fields of the "configuration" and "agentConfiguration" blocks):
- Initially, the full configuration is defined by [Default Configuration](../README.md#default-configuration).
- After that the configuration can be updated via Southbound REST API.
- The updated configuration is saved in non-volatile/flash memory and restored after the tracker application restart.

A cloud can ask the tracker to update the configuration. The update may include all configuration fields or a subset of them.

A cloud can ask the tracker to report the latest known configuration.

Default configuration, configuration updates and reported configuration - all use the same [Configuration JSON Format](#configuration-json-format).

## REST API ##

The tracker application (Imp-Agent part) implements the following REST API:
- Accepts `GET/PATCH https://<tracker_api_url>/cfg` requests. Where:
  - `<tracker_api_url>` - is the Imp-Agent URL. It comprises the base URL `agent.electricimp.com` plus the [agentâ€™s ID](https://developer.electricimp.com/faqs/terminology#agent). Example: `https://agent.electricimp.com/7jiDVu1t_w--`
  - `/cfg` - is an endpoint.
- Supports the basic authentication - `<username>/<password>`. Where:
  - `<username>/<password>` should be set as `CFG_REST_API_USERNAME`/`CFG_REST_API_PASSWORD` [Environment Variables](../README.md#user-defined-environment-variables) in the Imp application.
- Returns HTTP response code `401` if no or invalid authentication details are provided.

### GET /cfg ###

Reports the latest known configuration of the tracker application.

The tracker application (Imp-Agent part) returns:
- HTTP response code `200`
- HTTP message body with the reported configuration in the [Configuration JSON Format](#configuration-json-format):
  - "description" block - always exists,
  - "agentConfiguration" block - always exists,
  - "configuration" block - exists if known. Note, in some cases it can be absent, for example, while the tracker is in the shipment mode.

### PATCH /cfg ###

Requests an update of the tracker application configuration.

The configuration update may include all fields of the "configuration" and "agentConfiguration" blocks, a subset of the fields, or even a one field only. Note, some of the fields can be updated together only, it is specified in the [Configuration JSON Format](#configuration-json-format).

The tracker application (Imp-Agent part):
- Accepts message body with the configuration update in the [Configuration JSON Format](#configuration-json-format).
- Validates the correctness of the configuration update:
  - types of the field values,
  - supported ranges of the field values,
  - fields which should be updated together only, etc.
- Returns HTTP response code `400` if the configuration update is incorrect.
- Returns HTTP response code `200` if the configuration update passes all preliminary checks.
- Immediately applies "agentConfiguration" block of the configuration (if it exist in the configuration update).
- Saves "configuration" block of the configuration (if it exist in the configuration update) as a pending configuration and processes it.

#### Pending Configuration Processing ####

Every "configuration" update has a unique Id specified by a cloud. Note, [Default Configuration](../README.md#default-configuration) has a predefined Id.

Every "configuration" update from a cloud becomes a pending update. It stays pending till it is successfully delivered to the tracker (to the Imp-Device part of the tracker application).

There can be not more than one pending configuration update at a time. A new "configuration" update from a cloud overwrites the current pending update, if any. I.e. the cloud should wait for the previous update is delivered to the tracker and send a new update after that.

If there is a pending update, then the "description" block of the configuration reported by the tracker to a cloud includes the "pendingUpdateId" field - the Id of the current pending update. If there is no such a field, then no pending update is waiting for delivery to the tracker at this moment.

Note, a delivering of the "configuration" update to the tracker (absence of the pending update) does not mean the latest update has been already successfully applied. The update still can fail during applying and/or the tracker becomes offline and its actual configuration is not known yet.

The "configuration" block of the configuration reported by the tracker to a cloud always includes the "updateId" field - the Id of the latest known successfully applied configuration update.

## Configuration JSON Format ##

- All keys and values are case sensitive.
- All fields are optional, if not specified otherwise.
- Most of the fields which can be changed have "safeguards" - supported range and/or list of supported values.
- For more details about some of the settings and other information - see [Behavior Description](#behavior-description).
